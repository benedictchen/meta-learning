"""
Task difficulty assessment module.

Provides comprehensive analysis of task difficulty across multiple dimensions:
- Statistical complexity measures (class separability, feature complexity) 
- Learning dynamics analysis (convergence rate, gradient variance)
- Meta-learning specific measures (adaptation difficulty, generalization gap)
