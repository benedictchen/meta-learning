TODO: Advanced Task Difficulty Estimation Algorithm
===================================================

PRIORITY: CRITICAL - Replace hardcoded 0.5 difficulty values

Our current system has hardcoded 0.5 values throughout toolkit.py and complexity_analyzer.py.
This module creates a proper task difficulty estimation system that integrates multiple 
metrics to provide accurate difficulty scores for few-shot learning tasks.

INTEGRATION TARGET:
- Replace all hardcoded 0.5 values in toolkit.py
- Enhance existing ComplexityAnalyzer with meta-learning specific metrics
- Add episode-level difficulty estimation for few-shot tasks
- Integrate with curriculum learning and adaptive algorithms

RESEARCH FOUNDATIONS:
- Ho & Basu (2002): Complexity measures for pattern recognition
- Vanschoren (2018): Meta-learning surveys and difficulty estimation
- Cui et al. (2018): Large Scale Fine-grained Categorization and Domain-Specific Transfer Learning
